UTSOR stand for Unable To Synchronize On Requestor.
<BR>
UTSOR Smasher is an utility which sole purpose is to find out why an UTSOR was generated.
<BR>
<BR>
UTSOR support PRPC 7.1.8, PRPC 7.1.9, PRPC 7.2, PRPC 7.2.1, PRPC 7.2.2.
<BR>
Support for previous PRPC version will be added.
<BR>
INSTRUCTION: go to File->Scan Folder and provide a folder which contains both Pega logs and Pega Alert logs.
That's it!
<BR>
<BR>
How it works:
<BR>
UTSOR Smasher will scan PegaRules log file for any UTSOR alert, then will scan PegaRules Alert logs for any related alert.
Any alert related to the same affected user/thread will be returned.
<BR>
Yellow lines corresponds to alert generated during the typical 2 minutes hang before the Alert generated.
<BR>
Red lines corresponds to alert of high value and should contain pertinent information for this issue (based on extremely complicated algorithm :))
